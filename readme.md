# Picoware

Micropython OS for Picocalc

Use simple PSP-like navigation
+ main categories are cols
+ each cell is an app (py file with icon/symbol, bmp named like py-file)
+ navigate with arrow keys, Enter selects

    Screensavers (Spiro, Starfield, and more)
    Social Media Network (connected with Flipper Zero users)
